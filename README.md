Simple Slack Bot with Python on Replit

The project is an automated Slack notifications system developed using Python and Replit. It utilizes the Slack API and the Schedule library to send weekly notifications to a specified channel every Wednesday at 12:00. The key features include scheduled messaging, Slack integration, and flexibility for customization. The workflow involves initiating the script for the first notification, scheduling subsequent notifications, and running continuously to check and send messages accordingly. The project aims to showcase the practical application of automation to save time and enhance consistency in team communication.
